# `Vital Lung Capacity Predictor`

ü´Å A polynomial regression model used to predict the vital lung capacity (VLC) of an individual given their age.

### Purpose

This project was born from a science lab I had to conduct for school. The idea was to see how age impacted the vital lung capacity of an individual. I thought it'd be interesting to see how these values could be predicted by something like a polynomial regression model.
